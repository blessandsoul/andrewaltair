# Cyberpunk Coyote: The Ultimate Prompt

Are you ready to see Wile E. Coyote like never before? This prompt generates a stunning 8K resolution image of the classic character in a futuristic, neon-lit cyberpunk city.

## The Prompt

```markdown
/imagine prompt: character design of Wile E. Coyote as a cyberpunk mercenary, neon cybernetic implants, glowing yellow eyes, tactical vest with Acme branding, standing in a rainy neo-tokyo alleyway, volumetric lighting, 8k resolution, cinematic composition --ar 16:9 --v 6.0
```

## How It Works

1.  **Character Design**: We keep the core identity but add a "cyberpunk mercenary" twist.
2.  **Environment**: "Rainy Neo-Tokyo alleyway" provides the perfect atmosphere.
3.  **Lighting**: Volumetric lighting adds depth and realism.

### Pro Tips

*   Experiment with different weather conditions (e.g., "snowy", "foggy").
*   Change the branding on the vest to see other callbacks.
